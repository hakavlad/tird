Description: tool for encrypting files and hiding encrypted data
 tird (an acronym for "this is random data") is a file encryption tool
 focused on minimizing metadata and hiding encrypted data.
 .
 With tird, you can:
 1. Create files filled with random data to use as containers or
 keyfiles.
 2. Overwrite the contents of devices and regular files with random
 data. This can be used to prepare containers and to destroy residual
 data.
 3. Encrypt file contents and comments with modern cryptographic
 primitives. The encrypted file format (called cryptoblob) is a padded
 uniform random blob (PURB): it looks like random data and has a
 randomized size. This reduces metadata leakage from file format and
 length, and also allows cryptoblobs to be hidden among random data.
 You can use keyfiles and passphrases at your choice to enhance
 security.
 4. Create steganographic (hidden, undetectable) user-driven file
 systems inside container files and devices. Unlike VeraCrypt and
 Shufflecake containers, tird containers do not contain headers at all;
 the user specifies the location of the data in the container and is
 responsible for ensuring that this location is separated from the
 container.
 5. Resist coercive attacks (keywords: key disclosure law, rubber-hose
 cryptanalysis, xkcd 538). tird provides some forms of plausible
 deniability out of the box, even if you encrypt files without hiding
 them in containers.
