.IP \[bu] 2
symmetric encryption;
.IP \[bu] 2
reducing metadata leakage;
.IP \[bu] 2
hiding encrypted data;
.IP \[bu] 2
plausible deniability.
.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.SS -d, \[en]debug
.PP
print debug messages
.SH GOALS
.IP \[bu] 2
Providing protection for individual files, including:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
symmetric encryption;
.IP \[bu] 2
reducing metadata leakage;
.IP \[bu] 2
hiding encrypted data;
.IP \[bu] 2
plausible deniability.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Providing a stable encryption format with no cryptographic agility for
long-term data storage.
.IP \[bu] 2
No feature creep: refusal to implement features that are not directly
related to primary security goals.
