tird - encrypt files and hide encrypted data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tird\f[R] [\f[B]--debug\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]tird\f[R] \f[I](an acronym for \[lq]this is random data\[rq])\f[R]
is a file encryption tool focused on minimizing metadata and hiding
encrypted data.
.PP
With \f[B]tird\f[R], you can:
.IP "1." 3
Create files filled with random data to use as containers or keyfiles.
.IP "2." 3
Overwrite the contents of devices and regular files with random data.
This can be used to prepare containers and to destroy residual data.
.IP "3." 3
Encrypt file contents and comments with modern cryptographic primitives.
The encrypted file format (called cryptoblob) is a padded uniform random
blob (PURB): it looks like random data and has a randomized size.
This reduces metadata leakage from file format and length, and also
allows cryptoblobs to be hidden among random data.
You can use keyfiles and passphrases at your choice to enhance security.
.IP "4." 3
Create steganographic (hidden, undetectable) user-driven file systems
inside container files and devices.
Unlike VeraCrypt and Shufflecake containers, \f[B]tird\f[R] containers
do not contain headers at all; the user specifies the location of the
data in the container and is responsible for ensuring that this location
is separated from the container.
.IP "5." 3
Resist coercive attacks (keywords: key disclosure law, rubber-hose
cryptanalysis, xkcd 538).
\f[B]tird\f[R] provides some forms of plausible deniability out of the
box, even if you encrypt files without hiding them in containers.

.SH HIDDEN FILE SYSTEM AND CONTAINER FORMAT
.PP
You can encrypt files and embed cryptoblobs into containers starting at
arbitrary positions.
After writing the cryptoblob, you will need to remember its location in
the container (the starting and ending positions), which will be used
later to extract the cryptoblobs.
In this way, you can create a \f[B]hidden, headerless, user-driven\f[R]
file system inside a container:
.IP \[bu] 2
It is \f[B]hidden\f[R] because it is impossible to distinguish between
random container data and cryptoblob data, as well as to determine the
location of written cryptoblobs without knowing the positions and keys.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is \f[B]headerless\f[R] because containers do not contain any
headers; all data about cryptoblob locations must be stored separately
by the user.
.IP \[bu] 2
The starting position of the cryptoblob in the container is
\f[B]user-defined\f[R], and the \f[B]user must\f[R] store both the
starting and ending positions separately from the container.
This is why it is called a \f[B]user-driven file system\f[R].
.PP
Any file, disk, or partition larger than the minimum cryptonlob size
(863 B) can be a valid container.
Cryptoblobs can be embedded into any area.
.PP
\f[B]Examples of valid containers include:\f[R]
.IP "1." 3
Specially generated files with random data.
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]tird\f[R] cryptoblobs, as they contain unauthenticated padding of
random data by default, which can be used to embed smaller cryptoblobs.
.IP "3." 3
Disk areas containing random data.
For example, you can overwrite a disk with random data, format it in
FAT32 or exFAT, and use a large portion of the disk, leaving a few dozen
MB from the beginning.
The disk will appear empty unless you add some files to it.
.IP "4." 3
LUKS encrypted volumes.
.IP "5." 3
VeraCrypt containers, even those that already contain hidden volumes.
