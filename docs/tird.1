tird - encrypt files and hide encrypted data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tird\f[R] [\f[B]-d\f[R] | \f[B]\[en]debug\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]tird\f[R] \f[I](an acronym for \[lq]this is random data\[rq])\f[R]
is a tool for encrypting files and hiding encrypted data.
.PP
Using \f[B]tird\f[R] you can:
.IP "1." 3
Create files with random data.
Use them as containers or keyfiles.
.IP "2." 3
Overwrite the contents of devices and regular files with random data.
This can be used to prepare containers and to destroy residual data.
.IP "3." 3
Encrypt file contents and comments with modern cryptographic primitives.
The encrypted file format (cryptoblob) is padded uniform random blob
(PURB): it looks like random data and has randomized size.
This reduces metadata leakage through file format and length, and also
allows cryptoblobs to be hidden among random data.
.IP "4." 3
Create steganographic (hidden, undetectable) user-driven file systems
inside container files and devices.
Unlike VeraCrypt and Shufflecake containers, \f[B]tird\f[R] containers
do not contain headers at all: the user specifies the location of the
data in the container and is responsible for ensuring that this location
is separated from the container.
.IP "5." 3
Resist coercive attacks (keywords: key disclosure law, rubber-hose
cryptanalysis, xkcd 538).
\f[B]tird\f[R] provides some forms of plausible deniability out of the
box even if you encrypt files without hiding them in containers.
.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.SS -d, \[en]debug
.PP

.SH GOALS
.IP \[bu] 2
Providing protection for individual files, including:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
symmetric encryption and authentication;
.IP \[bu] 2
minimizing metadata leakage;
.IP \[bu] 2
preventing access to data in case of user coercion;
.IP \[bu] 2
plausible deniability of payload existence;
.IP \[bu] 2
hiding encrypted data.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Providing a stable encryption format with no cryptographic agility for
long-term data storage.
.IP \[bu] 2
Simplicity and no feature creep: refusal to implement features that are
not directly related to primary security goals.
.SH USAGE
.PP
You don\[cq]t need to remember command line options to use
\f[B]tird\f[R].
.PP
Just start \f[B]tird\f[R], select a menu option, and then answer the
questions that \f[B]tird\f[R] will ask:
.IP

.SH HIDDEN USER-DRIVEN FILE SYSTEM AND CONTAINER FILE FORMAT
.PP
You can encrypt files and write cryptoblobs over containers starting
with arbitary positions.
After finishing writing the cryptoblob, you will be asked to remember
the location of the cryptoblob in the container (positions of the
beginning and end of the cryptoblob), which can be used in the future to
extract the cryptoblob.
In this way, you can create a hidden user-driven file system inside a
container.
.PP
It is hidden because it is impossible to distinguish between random
container data and random cryptoblob data, and it is impossible to
determine the location of written cryptoblobs without knowing the
positions and keys.
.PP
Containers do not contain any headers, all data about cryptoblob
locations must be stored separately by the user.
.PP
The location of the start of the cryptoblob in the container is
user-defined, and the location of the start and end positions of the
cryptoblob must be stored by the user separately from the container.
This is why this \[lq]file system\[rq] is called a user-driven file
system.
