`tird` *(an acronym for "this is random data")* is a tool for encrypting files and hiding encrypted data.

With `tird`, you can:

1. Create files filled with random data to use as containers or keyfiles.
2. Overwrite the contents of block devices and regular files with random data. This can be used to prepare containers and to destroy residual data.
3. Encrypt file contents and comments with modern cryptographic primitives. The encrypted file format (cryptoblob) is a [padded uniform random blob (PURB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PURB_(cryptography)): it looks like random data and has a randomized size. This reduces metadata leakage from file format and length, and also allows cryptoblobs to be hidden among random data. You can use keyfiles and passphrases at your choice to enhance security.
4. Create [steganographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) (hidden, undetectable) user-driven file systems inside container files and block devices. Unlike [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.fr) and [Shufflecake](https://shufflecake.net/) containers, `tird` containers do not contain headers at all; the user specifies the location of the data in the container and is responsible for ensuring that this location is separated from the container.
5. Resist [coercive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion) attacks (keywords: [key disclosure law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law), [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption), [xkcd 538](https://xkcd.com/538/)). `tird` provides some forms of [plausible deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability) out of the box, even if you encrypt files without hiding them in containers.

## Goals

- **File Protection:** Ensuring protection for individual files, including:
  - Symmetric encryption and authentication.
  - Minimizing metadata leakage.
  - Preventing access to data in cases of user coercion.
  - Plausible deniability of payload existence.
  - Hiding encrypted data.
- **Stable Format:** Ensuring a stable encryption format with no [cryptographic agility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_agility) for long-term data storage.
- **Simplicity:** Ensuring simplicity and avoiding [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep): refusal to implement features that are not directly related to primary security goals.

## Cryptographic Primitives

The following cryptographic primitives are utilized by `tird`:

- `ChaCha20` cipher ([RFC 7539](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7539.html)) for data encryption.
- `BLAKE2` ([RFC 7693](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7693.html)) for hashing and authentication.
- `Argon2` memory-hard function ([RFC 9106](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html)) for key stretching and key derivation.

For more details, refer to the [specification](https://github.com/hakavlad/tird/blob/main/docs/SPECIFICATION.md).

## Encrypted Data Format

```

Files encrypted with `tird` cannot be distinguished from random data without knowledge of the keys and have no identifiable headers. `tird` produces cryptoblobs that contain bilateral [randomized padding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography)#Randomized_padding) with uniform random data (PURBs). This minimizes metadata leaks from the file format and makes it possible to hide cryptoblobs among other random data.

## Hidden File System and Container Format

`tird` employs a technique that is [described](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_steganography_techniques#Digital) as follows:

> Concealing data within encrypted data or within random data. The message to conceal is encrypted, then used to overwrite part of a much larger block of encrypted data or a block of random data (an unbreakable cipher like the one-time pad generates ciphertexts that look perfectly random without the private key).

You can encrypt files and embed cryptoblobs into containers starting at arbitrary positions. After writing the cryptoblob, you will need to remember its location in the container (the starting and ending positions), which will be used later to extract the cryptoblobs. In this way, you can create a **hidden, headerless, user-driven file system** inside a container:

- It is **hidden** because it is impossible to distinguish between random container data and cryptoblob data, as well as to determine the location of written cryptoblobs without knowing the positions and keys.
- It is **headerless** because containers do not contain any headers; all data about cryptoblob locations must be stored separately by the user.
- The starting position of the cryptoblob in the container is **user-defined**, and the **user must** store both the starting and ending positions separately from the container. This is why it is called a **user-driven file system**.

Any file, disk, or partition larger than the minimum cryptonlob size (608 B) can be a valid container. Cryptoblobs can be embedded into any area.

**Examples of valid containers include:**

1. Specially generated files with random data.
2. Disk areas containing random data. For example, you can overwrite a disk with random data, format it in FAT32 or exFAT, and use a large portion of the disk, leaving a few dozen MB from the beginning. The disk will appear empty unless you add some files to it.
3. `tird` cryptoblobs, as they contain unauthenticated padding of random data by default, which can be used to embed smaller cryptoblobs.
4. VeraCrypt containers, even those that already contain hidden volumes.

**Example of Container Structure:**

```
+—————————+—————————————+ <— Position 0 of the container
|         |             |
|         | Random data |
|         |             |
|         +—————————————+ <— Cryptoblob1 start position
| Header- |             |
| less    | Cryptoblob1 |
|         |             |
| Layer   +—————————————+ <— Cryptoblob1 end position
|         | Random data |
| Cake    +—————————————+ <— Cryptoblob2 start position
|         |             |
|         | Cryptoblob2 |
|         |             |
|         +—————————————+ <— Cryptoblob2 end position
|         | Random data |
+—————————+—————————————+
```

A detailed description of these options with examples can be found [here](https://github.com/hakavlad/tird/blob/main/docs/INPUT_OPTIONS.md).

## Debug Mode

Start `tird` with the `--debug` option to look under the hood while the program is running:

```bash
$ tird --debug
```

Enabling debug messages additionally shows:

- File operations:
  - Opening and closing of file descriptors.
  - Real paths to opened files.
  - Movement of file pointers.
- Byte strings related to cryptographic operations: salts, passphrases, digests, keys, nonces, and tags.
- Some other information, including various sizes.

## Tradeoffs and Limitations

- `tird` does not support:
  - [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).
  - File compression.
  - ASCII armored output.
  - [Reed–Solomon error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction).
  - Splitting the output into chunks.
  - The use of [standard streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) for processing files.
  - Low-level block device reading and writing on MS Windows. As a result, these devices cannot be used as keyfiles, cannot be overwritten, and cannot be encrypted or embedded.
- `tird` does not provide:
  - A graphical user interface.
  - A password generator.
- `tird` cannot handle (encrypt/embed) more than one file in one pass. Encryption of directories and multiple files is not supported.
- `tird` does not fake file access, modification, and creation timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime).
- `tird`'s encryption speed is not very high (up to 550 MiB/s in my tests).

## Warnings

![ACHTUNG MINEN](https://i.imgur.com/1Cdy7ER.jpeg)

- ⚠️ The author does not have a background in cryptography.
- ⚠️ The code has 0% test coverage.
- ⚠️ `tird` has not been independently audited.
- ⚠️ `tird` is ineffective in a compromised environment; executing it in such cases may cause disastrous data leaks.
- ⚠️ `tird` is unlikely to be effective when used with short and predictable keys.
- ⚠️ Sensitive data may leak into swap space.
- ⚠️ `tird` does not erase its sensitive data from memory after use.
- ⚠️ `tird` always releases unverified plaintext, violating [The Cryptographic Doom Principle](https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html).
- ⚠️ `tird` doesn't sort digests of keyfiles and passphrases in constant-time.
- ⚠️ Padding sizes depend on secret values.
- ⚠️ Padding contents are never authenticated; authentication only applies to the ciphertext, salts, and certain sizes.
- ⚠️ Overwriting file contents does not guarantee secure destruction of data on the media.
- ⚠️ You cannot prove to an adversary that your random data does not contain encrypted information.
- ⚠️ `tird` protects data, not the user; it cannot prevent torture if you are under suspicion.
- ⚠️ Development is not complete, and there may be backward compatibility issues.
