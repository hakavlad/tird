`tird` *(an acronym for "this is random data")* is a tool for encrypting file contents and hiding random data among other random data.

## Goals

- Long-term protection for individual files:
    - symmetric encryption;
    - deniable encryption;
    - minimizing metadata leakage;
    - data hiding.

## Cryptoblob structure
```
                     512B          0+B
                 +----------+---------------+
                 | comments | file contents |
                 +----------+---------------+
  16B     0+B    |        plaintext         | 64B     0+B     16B
+------+---------+--------------------------+-----+---------+------+
| salt | padding |        ciphertext        | MAC | padding | salt |
+------+---------+--------------------------+-----+---------+------+
|  urandom data  |      random-looking data       |  urandom data  |
+----------------+--------------------------------+----------------+
```

## Tradeoffs and limitations

- `tird` does not support asymmetric encryption and signatures.
- `tird` does not support file compression.
- `tird` does not support ASCII armored output.
- `tird` does not support Reedâ€“Solomon error correction.
- `tird` does not support splitting the output into chunks.
- `tird` does not support low-level device reading and writing when used on MS Windows (devices cannot be used as keyfiles, cannot be overwritten, cannot be encrypted or hidden).
- `tird` does not provide a graphical user interface (may be implemented later).
- `tird` does not provide a password generator.
- `tird` does not wipe sensitive data from the heap.
- `tird` can only encrypt one file per iteration. Encryption of directories and multiple files is not supported.
- `tird` does not fake file timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime).
- `tird` encryption speed is not very fast: up to 186 MiB/s (in my tests).

## Warnings

- ðŸš© The author is not a cryptographer.
- ðŸš© `tird` has not been independently audited.
- ðŸš© `tird` probably won't help much when used in a compromised environment.
- ðŸš© `tird` probably won't help much when used with short and predictable keys.
- ðŸš© Keys may leak into the swap space.
- ðŸš© `tird` violates [The Cryptographic Doom Principle](https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html).
- ðŸš© `tird` does not sort digests of passphrases and keyfiles in constant time.
- ðŸš© Development is ongoing, there may be backward compatibility issues in the future.

## Usage

Just run the script, select the option you want and then answer the questions.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- PyNaCl >= 1.2.0 (provides `Argon2` KDF)
- PyCryptodomex >= 3.6.2 (provides `ChaCha20` cipher)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install tird
```

## TODO

- Write documentation.
